Write a program to input an integer 'n' and print the sum of all its even digits and the sum of all its odd digits separately.


Digits mean numbers, not places! That is, if the given integer is "132456", even digits are 2, 4, and 6, and odd digits are 1, 3, and 5.


Example :
Input: 'n' = 132456

Output: 12 9

Explanation:
The sum of even digits = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12
The sum of odd digits = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
Input format :
 The first line contains an integer 'n'.


Output format :
In a single line, print two space-separated integers, first the sum of even digits and then the sum of odd digits.
Sample Input 1:
132456


Sample Output 1:
12 9


Explanation of sample input 1 :
The sum of even digits = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12
The sum of odd digits = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9


Sample Input 2:
552245


Sample Output 2:
8 15


Constraints
0<= 'n' <=10000


import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
		int num=s.nextInt();
		int digit;
		int ev=0,odd=0;
		while(num>0)
		{
			digit=num%10;
			num=num/10;
			if(digit%2!=0)
				odd=odd+digit;
			else
				ev=ev+digit;
		}
		System.out.print(ev+" "+odd);

	}
}

Sum of even & odd
Problem Description: You are given an input integer N, and you have to calculate the sum of its
odd and even digits separately.
For example, if the given number is 24321, then sum of it’s even digit=2+4+2=8 and odd
digits=3+1=4.
How to approach?
1. Take the number as input from the user.
2. Initialize both even sum and odd sum from 0.
3. Now, start picking up the last digit by taking modulo 10 while number is greater than 0
and check whether the last digit is odd or even.
4. If the last digit is odd then, add it to then odd sum otherwise add it to the even sum and
pass the number by dividing it to 10 to the next iteration.
5. Print even sum and odd sum.
Pseudo Code for this problem:
Input = number
Even sum=0
odd sum=0
While number is greater than 0:
 Last digit=number%10
 If last digit is even:
 even sum=even sum+last digit
 Else:
 odd sum=odd sum+last digit
 number=number/10
Print(even sum odd sum)
❏ Let us dry run the code:
number=345276
● Even sum=0
Odd sum=0
● Last digit=6
6 is even, so even sum=0+6=6
number=34527
● Last digit=7
7 is odd, so odd sum=0+7=7
number=3452
● Last digit=2
2 is even, so even sum=6+2=8
number=345
● Last digit=5
5 is odd, so odd sum=7+5=12
number=34
● Last digit=4
4 is even, so even sum=8+4=12
number=3
● Last digit=3
3 is odd, so odd sum=12+3=15
number=0
● Now number is not greater than 0 here so we stop and print both even and odd
sum.
Output:
12 15
