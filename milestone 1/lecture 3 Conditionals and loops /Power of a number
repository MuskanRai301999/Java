Find power of a number
Send Feedback
Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to print the answer.
Note : For this question, you can assume that 0 raised to the power of 0 is 1


Input format :
Two integers x and n (separated by space)
Output Format :
x^n (i.e. x raise to the power n)
Constraints:
0 <= x <= 8 
0 <= n <= 9
Sample Input 1 :
 3 4
Sample Output 1 :
81
Sample Input 2 :
 2 5
Sample Output 2 :
32



Problem Description: You are given a number x and another number n. You have to print x (x n
raised to the power n).
For example, if x=3 and n=2 then, you have to print 9 ( 3 ). 2
How to approach?
1. Take x and n as input from the user.
2. x^n basically means, multiplying x, n times. So, initialize an ans with 1.
3. Now, run a loop until n becomes 0, and multiply x with ans each time.
4. Print the final ans obtained.
Pseudo code for this problem:
Input = x
Input= n
ans=1
While n is greater than 0:
 ans=ans*x
 Decrement n by 1
Print(ans)
❏ Let us dry run the code:
 x=4 and n=2
● ans =1
● n=2(>0), so ans=1*4=4
● n=1(>0), so ans=4*4=16
● n=0(==0), so move out of the loop and we will print the ans
● Output:
16


import java.util.Scanner;
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
          Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
         int x=s.nextInt();//number
         int n=s.nextInt();//power
         int ans=1;
         for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
         {
              ans=ans*x;
         }
         System.out.println(ans);
        
        
        
    }
}
